# 1. Organize the data -- selected cols + 1 row for each obs; all obs for genus + The Arb together 
#      -  Maybe start with a single species -- ideally ~100 data points
# 2.Reformat the data for an NMS -- nonmetric multidimensional scaling (similar to PCA = principle components analysis)
#    - when fitting any sort of ordination or AI, generally 3x as many rows as you have columns
#    - Variables Chosen by Shiven:
#          # T_GRAVEL (Gravel Content): composition of soil is very important
#          # T_SAND (Sand Fraction): composition of soil is very important
#          # T_SILT (Silt Fraction): composition of soil is very important
#          # T_CLAY (Clay Fraction): composition of soil is very important
#          # T_USDA_TEX_CLASS: combination of clay, silt, sand in soil
#          # T_OC: says on the technical report that with the pH it is the best indicator of the health status of the soil
#          # T_PH_Hâ‚‚O: very important to know the pH of the soil
#          # T_TEB: total exchangeable bases, important because it measures the nutrients the soils provide
#          # T_ECE: electrical conductivity, important as it detects salt in soils
#          # AWC (Avg. Water Storage Capacity): how much rain it can handle, need something that has similar water capacity to Arb
#          # T_REF_BULK_DENSITY: amount of space the particles occupy (how compacted)

# 3. Parts to look at with the NMS:
#     - How much variance is explained by each axis?
#     - What variables load (correlate) with each axis?
#     - Are species in separate clumps or really mixed together?
#     - Where does the Arboretum lie in the messy clump?
#
